The KTL tracker extracted 100 features from frc1 and frc2 which is plotted on the submitted images.
These points were then read into matlab and a Fundamental matrix was estimated using estimateF from the earlier part of F.
As you can see in the sumbitted KtlEpipolarlines image, the F and subsequently the generated epipolar lines are better than randomly selecting corresponding points.
This is because features are stronger cues and provide less noisy data and more meaningful correspondences when attempting to generate the Fundamental matrix F.
